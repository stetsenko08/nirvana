							<p>Nirvana is one of the most popular bands of all time. They invented a new gander of music called, grunge which influenced the fashion and music in the 90's and even sometimes today. It was first formd by Kurt Cobain and Krist Novoselic in 1987. They relised their debue album in 1989 which was called bleach. This album was the first taste of fame but Nevermind, the second published album made the band known world wide. The drummer of the famous band only joined while the recordings were happening for nevermind. His name was Dave Grohl.The last officially released album was, In Utero which was in 1993. Sadly the death of the band's lead singer followed the next year which also spilted the band up. </p>
